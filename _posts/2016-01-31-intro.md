#Plants, Animals, and Their Homes:

Rainforests have many animals in groups like arachnids, birds, mammals, insects, and reptiles. The range of animals is endless! There are alligators, butterflies, frogs, snakes like the anaconda, ants, apes, bats, birds like parrots and toucans, caimans which are like baby little crocodiles, caterpillars, chimpanzees, lizards, dragonflies, frogs, jaguars, mice, piranhas, lemurs, and turtles. The animals do very well in the rainforest because there are so many plants for homes and food and water to drink. The places they live are in are on the forest floor, the understory, the canopy, and the emergent levels. The forest floor is the darkest layer of the forest. With so many trees hiding the light the amount of new plants is limited so animals that feed on new leaves canâ€™t live on the forest floor. The forest floor however is home to some of the largest animals in the rainforest. It is also home to lots of insects. The understory level is a cool dark area for animals to live. The third level of the rainforest is the canopy. The canopy is the upper level of the trees that blocks the lower levels of the rainforest from sunlight. The canopy is full of life. This level is home to many insects, mammals, birds, and reptiles. The last level of the rainforest is the emergent level. This level is where giant trees stick out above the rest. These trees are much taller that the other canopy trees. Birds and insects live in this layer.

There are also many plants in a rainforest. The trees are very tall and make the ground very dark. The many branches and broad leaves take in all of the light. When an old tree falls, there is a gap in the canopy and the light flows to the forest floor. New trees start to grow and the trees race each other to get the spot in the sunlight. The trees need to get a good start if they are to live. The old tree becomes home for new plants and animals. The hardwood trees are the tallest trees in the forest and are the emergent trees.
