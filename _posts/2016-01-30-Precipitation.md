#Precipitation:

Over two yards of rain falls per year in a rainforest. It doesn’t rain every day but it rains more in rainforests than the rest of the world. A single tree can suck up hundreds of tons of water a year but they can’t use all of the water. The leftover water is put into the air as fog. About half of the rain that falls in a rainforest comes from clouds made from the forest’s own trees. The world’s largest rivers are found in rainforests because it rains so often.
